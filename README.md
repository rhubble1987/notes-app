  ## Description:  
  For this homework, we were to build the backend for a notetaking app. This app functions like a standard notetaking app by allowing users to enter and save notes, edit notes, and delete notes.  

  ---  

  ## Installation:  
  To install this app, simply access the following URL: https://intense-headland-49606.herokuapp.com/  

  ---  

  ## Usage:  
  From the main page, select "Get Started." Then on the notes page, enter a title and note text for your first note. To save it, click the floppy disk icon in the upper righthand corner of the screen. You will then see it saved on the left side of the screen. To access this note later, simply click on the note's title on the left. If you'd like to delete a note, simply click the red trashcan icon next to it in the list of notes.

  ## Licensing:  
  Public Domain - App can be shared and modified however you want!

  ## Challenges:  
  The most challenging aspect of this was getting the API and HTML routes set up correctly. At first when I first had the routes set up, the server was sending the HTML files as if they were Javascript, which was causing an error in the browser. To get past this, I learned that we needed to use express.status middleware to resolve this.
